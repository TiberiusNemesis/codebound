Welcome to *Codebound*, a repository where I document my journey through the realms of software engineering and computer science.
## Overview

This repository is a collection of markdown files containing my annotations and study notes. Containing algorithms, data structures, best practices, software engineering principles, you can find it all. From fundamental concepts all the way to the tiniest details -- this is my digital garden, where knowledge grows and ideas intertwine.

## Table of Contents

- Computer Science
  - Algorithms
  - Asymptotic Notation
  - Data Structures

- Software Engineering
  - The Internet

## How to use this repository

Navigate through the folders to find study notes on various topics. Each markdown file is an annotation or a collection of notes on a particular concept. All of them are original content -- they are my own words describing my understanding of the topic.
