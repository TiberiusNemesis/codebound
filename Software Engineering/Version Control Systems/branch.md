# Branch

A branch is an independent line of development in a repository. In essence, each branch is a separate sequence of commits that can represent diverging changes being made to a different set of files in the same repository.

## Working with Branches

Creating a branch involves making a new pointer to the current commit. From that point on, the new branch can proceed in a new direction, having its changes be separate from the origin branch. Switching between branches is also possible, enabling a user to work with a separate set of files, possibly in two different tasks at once that require changing different files (or the same file in different ways).
