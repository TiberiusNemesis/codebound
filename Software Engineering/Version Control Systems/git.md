# Git

Git (sometimes called Git SCM) is a tool used to track and manage changes made in software code. That's the main usage of git, but really, being a highly capable version control system, it can be utilized for tracking more than just code.

As of December 2023, it is the most widely utilized version control system in software engineering.

Git works by tracking folders and subfolders, along with the files contained in them. It works by storing changes to these files in a type of database -- then allowing for these changes to be reverted, tracked, modified, combined, shared, and managed in a multitude of ways, even if a large number of people are working on the same files. 

A folder structure being tracked by git is called a *repository*, and inside a repository, we can save a snapshot of the folder structure by using a *commit* (multiple commits, each one representing a different version with additional changes applied).

Commits are organized in a structure called a *branch.* Each branch represents a different, independent sequence of changes, and to combine different sets of changes together, a merge or a rebase can be performed; the end result is that one branch will absorb the other branch's commits and changes applied.
