# PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL is a relational database management system (RDBMS) that uses SQL (Structured Query Language) to manage data. The main difference from other RDBMS is that PostgreSQL is object-relational, meaning that it allows for more complex data types and relationships, like JSON. It's also ACID compliant, meaning that it guarantees atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability.

There's also more advanced constraint mechanics not available in other database management systems. For example, check constraints can be performed on tables, which allows for more complex data validation. Here's an example of a check constraint that would only be possible in Postgres:

```sql
CREATE TABLE financial_transactions (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    amount NUMERIC CHECK (amount > 0),
    transaction_date TIMESTAMP 
        CHECK (transaction_date <= CURRENT_TIMESTAMP),
    status TEXT 
        CHECK (status IN ('pending', 'completed', 'failed'))
);
```
