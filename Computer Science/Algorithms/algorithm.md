# Algorithms

Algorithms are a set of instructions (or rules) to complete a certain task or solve a problem.  
We can see it as a step-by-step on how to achieve something.

There are several parts and formal definitions to an algorithm.

### Definiteness

Every step of an algorithm needs to be precisely defined, and each action needs to be clear and unambiguous.

### Input and Output

Algorithms have zero or more inputs (i.e. values or data received) and one or more outputs. These outputs are the result of the algorithm's processing.

### Finiteness

Any algorithm must end after a finite number of steps, i.e. it cannot go on indefinitely.

### Effectiveness

Each step of the algorithm needs to be basic and simple enough that it can be carried out (in principle) by a person using only a pencil and paper.

### Generality

The algorithm should be applicable for all problems in a desired form, i.e. it can't work on just a single set of data.

## Time Complexity

A concept that expresses the amount of resources (usually time) it takes to run an algorithm. Basically, it's a way to express the efficiency or speed of an algorithm by the number of operations it performs before reaching the desired result. Usually, thi number is expressed as a function of the size of the input data, which is often referred to as "n".

Most of the time, time complexity is expressed by Big O notation, which defines the worst-case scenario for an algorithm's runtime. It can also be expressed by Big Θ and Big Ω to define the average and best-case scenarios.
