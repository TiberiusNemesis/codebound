# Bubble Sort

One of, if not the most simple sorting algorithm. Usually performed in an array, bubble sort consists in going over each element of a list, comparing adjacent elements and *if the current element is greater than the next, they swap places.*

This essentially makes it so for every pass, at least one element will have its position changed until the data structure is sorted. However, this also makes it so the worst-case scenario (e.g. the lowest element being at the end of the list) is O(nÂ²), aka polynomial runtime.
