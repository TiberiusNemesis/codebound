# Bubble Sort

One of, if not the most simple sorting [algorithm](Computer%20Science/Algorithms/algorithm.md). Usually performed in an [array](Computer%20Science/Data%20Structures/array.md), bubble sort consists in going over each element of a list, comparing adjacent elements and *if the current element is greater than the next, they swap places.*

This essentially makes it so for every pass, at least one element will have its position changed until the [data structure](Computer%20Science/Data%20Structures/data%20structure.md) is sorted. However, this also makes it so the worst-case scenario (e.g. the lowest element being at the end of the list) is O(nÂ²), aka [polynomial runtime](Computer%20Science/Asymptotic%20Notation/Common%20Runtimes/polynomial%20runtime.md).
