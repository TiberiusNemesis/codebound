# Insertion Sort

Similar to [selection sort](Computer%20Science/Algorithms/Sorting/selection%20sort.md), in this [algorithm](Computer%20Science/Algorithms/algorithm.md) the [array](Computer%20Science/Data%20Structures/array.md) is split into a sorted and an unsorted portion. In each pass, a value from the unsorted portion gets placed into its correct position inside the sorted portion.

Therefore, with each pass, the sorted portion gets "rebuilt" with more elements being inserted at the correct position.

This [algorithm](Computer%20Science/Algorithms/algorithm.md) has a worst-case and average-case scenario of O(nÂ²), i.e. quadratic aka [logarithmic runtime](Computer%20Science/Asymptotic%20Notation/Common%20Runtimes/logarithmic%20runtime.md). It does perform quite well on small datasets or nearly-sorted arrays, however.
