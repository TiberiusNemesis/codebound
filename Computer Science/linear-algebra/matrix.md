# Matrix

A matrix is a two-dimensional array of numbers. We write it as A.
In a more formal definition, A ∈ ℝ^{m×n} (m rows, n cols).

Transposing a matrix is the process of interchanging its rows and columns. We write it as Aᵀ.

So for example,
A = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
Aᵀ = [[1, 4], [2, 5], [3, 6]]

## Identity Matrix

The identity matrix is a square matrix with ones on the diagonal and zeros elsewhere. We write it as I.
We can also write it as Iₙ (n×n).

So for example,
I = [[1, 0], [0, 1]]
I₃ = [[1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1]]
