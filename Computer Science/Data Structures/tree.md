# Tree

Trees are a category of non-linear data structures, where its elements (called nodes) are arranged in a hierarchical structure which kinda looks like branches of a real-world tree.

These nodes are connected by lines called edges. There are several kinds of trees, the most common type being the [binary tree](Computer%20Science/Data%20Structures/Tree/binary%20tree.md).

This kind of [data structure](Computer%20Science/Data%20Structures/data%20structure.md) is diverse, and has many different applications, including but not restricted to: file systems, databases, compression algorithms, machine learning, network design, cryptography, and web development.
