# Balanced Tree

A balanced tree is a type of data structure -- specifically, a type of binary tree that maintains the elements (i.e. the nodes) in a sorted order, ensuring the tree remains "balanced" by not allowing large height discrepancies.

A tree is considered balanced if, for every node in that tree, the height of the left subtree and the right subtree have a difference of *at most* one. This condition ensures that the tree's height is O(log n), where n is the number of nodes in that tree.

This is useful because it allows operations to be performed in logarithmic time, making them very efficient even when using large sets of data.

Balanced tree subtypes include AVL trees, Red-Black trees, B-Trees, B+ Trees, and Splay Trees.
