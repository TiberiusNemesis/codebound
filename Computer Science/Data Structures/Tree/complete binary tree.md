# Complete Binary Tree

A type of [binary tree](Computer%20Science/Data%20Structures/Tree/binary%20tree.md) where all nodes up until the last level have two children. The last level does not need to be entirely filled, but all nodes must be aligned to the left side of the [tree](Computer%20Science/Data%20Structures/tree.md).
