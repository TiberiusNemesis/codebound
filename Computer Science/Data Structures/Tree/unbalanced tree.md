# Unbalanced Tree

An unbalanced [tree](Computer%20Science/Data%20Structures/tree.md) is the opposite of a [balanced tree](Computer%20Science/Data%20Structures/Tree/balanced%20tree.md).
It does not follow height rules and therefore subtrees can grow to have large height discrepancies.

This kind of [data structure](Computer%20Science/Data%20Structures/data%20structure.md) may lead to larger time consumption when performing operations.
