# Directed Graph

A subtype of the [graph](Computer%20Science/Data%20Structures/graph.md) [data structure](Computer%20Science/Data%20Structures/data%20structure.md), where each one of the vertices has a *direction* associated to it.

This allows for a one-way relationship between nodes (as opposed to an [undirected graph](Computer%20Science/Data%20Structures/Graph/undirected%20graph.md), which we always assume to be a two-way relationship whenever two nodes are linked).

They can be used to represent networks (such as roads, telecummunications and social networks), state machines, and precedence among events or tasks (thus being used as a scheduler), as well as being a key prerequisite in pathfinding algorithms such as Djikstra's [algorithm](Computer%20Science/Algorithms/algorithm.md) and A*.

Like a standard [graph](Computer%20Science/Data%20Structures/graph.md), a directed [graph](Computer%20Science/Data%20Structures/graph.md) can be represented by an [adjacency list](Computer%20Science/Data%20Structures/Graph/adjacency%20list.md) or an [adjacency matrix](Computer%20Science/Data%20Structures/Graph/adjacency%20matrix.md).
