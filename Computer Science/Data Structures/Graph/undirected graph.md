# Directed Graph

A subtype of the [graph](Computer%20Science/Data%20Structures/graph.md) [data structure](Computer%20Science/Data%20Structures/data%20structure.md), where each one of the vertices has **no direction** associated to it.

They can be used to represent social networks (connections between people, since each edge would indicate a mutual relationship), physical networks (roads or water systems),or biological systems such as neural or genetic networks. A common search [algorithm](Computer%20Science/Algorithms/algorithm.md), depth-first search (and its counterpart, breadth-first search) can also be applied in undirected graphs.

Like a standard [graph](Computer%20Science/Data%20Structures/graph.md), an undirected [graph](Computer%20Science/Data%20Structures/graph.md) can be represented by an [adjacency list](Computer%20Science/Data%20Structures/Graph/adjacency%20list.md) or an [adjacency matrix](Computer%20Science/Data%20Structures/Graph/adjacency%20matrix.md).
