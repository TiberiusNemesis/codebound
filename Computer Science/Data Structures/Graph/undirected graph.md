# Directed Graph

A subtype of the graph data structure, where each one of the vertices has **no direction** associated to it. 

They can be used to represent social networks (connections between people, since each edge would indicate a mutual relationship), physical networks (roads or water systems),or biological systems such as neural or genetic networks. A common search algorithm, depth-first search (and its counterpart, breadth-first search) can also be applied in undirected graphs.

Like a standard graph, an undirected graph can be represented by an adjacency list or an adjacency matrix.
