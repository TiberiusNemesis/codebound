# Exponential runtime

Any algorithm that grows at a rate of 2 to the power of n (n being the input size) is dubbed *exponential*.

This means that for any additional input, the algorithm's runtime will double. This is, in layman's terms, terrible.

Big O representation for polynomial runtime is O(2^n) where n is the size of the input.
