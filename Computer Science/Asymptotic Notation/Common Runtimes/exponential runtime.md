# Exponential runtime

Any [algorithm](Computer%20Science/Algorithms/algorithm.md) that grows at a rate of 2 to the power of n (n being the input size) is dubbed *exponential*.

This means that for any additional input, the [algorithm](Computer%20Science/Algorithms/algorithm.md)'s runtime will double. This is, in layman's terms, terrible.

[Big O](Computer%20Science/Asymptotic%20Notation/Big%20O.md) representation for [polynomial runtime](Computer%20Science/Asymptotic%20Notation/Common%20Runtimes/polynomial%20runtime.md) is O(2^n) where n is the size of the input.
