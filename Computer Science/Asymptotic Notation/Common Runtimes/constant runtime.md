# Constant runtime

We can say an [algorithm](Computer%20Science/Algorithms/algorithm.md) has a constant runtime whenever it takes the same amount of time to run regardless of the size of the input. This would represent the best case scenario for an [algorithm](Computer%20Science/Algorithms/algorithm.md). Not often achieved in the real world, since different inputs will most likely require a varying number of steps to reach our desired output.

[Big O](Computer%20Science/Asymptotic%20Notation/Big%20O.md) representation for constant runtime is O(x) where x is a number that does not change in function of n (the size of the input). Examples include O(1), O(5), or O(20).
