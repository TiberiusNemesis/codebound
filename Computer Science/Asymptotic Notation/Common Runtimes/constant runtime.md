# Constant runtime

We can say an algorithm has a constant runtime whenever it takes the same amount of time to run regardless of the size of the input. This would represent the best case scenario for an algorithm. Not often achieved in the real world, since different inputs will most likely require a varying number of steps to reach our desired output.

Big O representation for constant runtime is O(x) where x is a number that does not change in function of n (the size of the input). Examples include O(1), O(5), or O(20).
