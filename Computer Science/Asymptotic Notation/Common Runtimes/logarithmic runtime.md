# Logarithmic complexity

We can say an [algorithm](Computer%20Science/Algorithms/algorithm.md) has *logarithmic* complexity when the running time (or the resource consumption) of that [algorithm](Computer%20Science/Algorithms/algorithm.md) grows in a logarithmic function of n (the size of the input). In most scenarios, this would be considered the optimal solution (since constant runtimes are often not realistically achievable).

[Big O](Computer%20Science/Asymptotic%20Notation/Big%20O.md) representation for logarithmic runtime is O(log(n)) where *n* represents the number of elements of the input.
