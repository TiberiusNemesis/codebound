# Logarithmic complexity

We can say an algorithm has *logarithmic* complexity when the running time (or the resource consumption) of that algorithm grows in a logarithmic function of n (the size of the input). In most scenarios, this would be considered the optimal solution (since constant runtimes are often not realistically achievable).

Big O representation for logarithmic runtime is O(log(n)) where *n* represents the number of elements of the input.
