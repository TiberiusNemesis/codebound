# Polynomial runtime

Algorithms that possess a runtime that grows in a polynomial function of the input size. This means that if the input size is 10, it will run 10 to the Kth power times more than if the input size was 1. They are considered far from optimal.

[Big O](Computer%20Science/Asymptotic%20Notation/Big%20O.md) representation for polynomial runtime is O(n^k) where n is the size of the input and k is a constant. Examples include O(n²), and O(n³).
