# Linear runtime

Any algorithm with its runtime directly proportional to the size of the input is said to have a *linear runtime.*

In essence, if the input size is 5, the runtime will grow in that same factor, i.e. 5 times the runtime of the algorithm if the input size was 1. If the input size is 100, it will be 100 times the runtime of the size 1 input.

Big O representation for linear runtime is O(n) where n represents the size of the input.
