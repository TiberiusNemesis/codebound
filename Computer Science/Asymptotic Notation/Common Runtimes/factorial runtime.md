# Factorial runtime

Widely considered to be the worst runtime achievable, factorial runtime represents an [algorithm](Computer%20Science/Algorithms/algorithm.md) where, for every additional input element, the runtime grows in a factorial manner. It's pretty damn hard to get here.

It's represented as O(!n). If you ever see this [Big O](Computer%20Science/Asymptotic%20Notation/Big%20O.md), that's a very bad sign.
