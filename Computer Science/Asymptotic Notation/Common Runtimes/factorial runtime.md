# Factorial runtime

Widely considered to be the worst runtime achievable, factorial runtime represents an algorithm where, for every additional input element, the runtime grows in a factorial manner. It's pretty damn hard to get here.

It's represented as O(!n). If you ever see this Big O, that's a very bad sign.
